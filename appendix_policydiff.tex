\section*{Appendix: Bellman and CEC parameter comparisons}\label{sec:parameter_comparison}
This article contains many numerical experiments on a system
with a fixed combination of the five parameters:
Termination time $T$, unsold items cost $C$, uncertainty $\gamma$, and
demand function parameters $q_1,q_2$.
In this section we explore the differences between the Bellman policy
and the CEC policy for a larger parameter range.
The Bellman policy function $a^B$ is computed numerically, and
the CEC function $a^C$ is given by the formula in
\Cref{eq:cec_policy}.

To reduce the number of combinations of parameters, we make the
following simplifications:
(i)~Only look at the difference of the final decision point, $T-1$.
(ii)~Choose four combinations of
$(C,\gamma)\in\{0.5,1\}\times\{0.05,0.1\}$.
Then,
for each combination of $(C,\gamma)$,
we can create a heatmap of the difference between the two policy
functions by varying the parameters $q_1,q_2$.
The $L^2$ difference between the
policy function $a^B(T-1,\cdot)$ and $a^C(T-1,\cdot)$
gives us a measure of how different the pricing decisions are for
the Bellman policy and the CEC policy.
This comparison is shown in \Cref{fig:policy_diff_heatmaps}.

  \caption{The $L^2$ difference $\|a^B(T-1,\cdot)-a^C(T-1,\cdot)\|_2$
    between the Bellman and CEC policy functions on $s\in[0,1]$.
    Each plot defines a combination of $(C,\gamma)$, whilst
    the axes vary the parameters $q_1,q_2$ of the demand function
    $q(a)=q_1e^{-q_2a}$.
    The difference is largest for small values of $q_1$ and $q_2$,
    which represent inelastic products with low absolute demand.
    The $L^2$ difference seems to scale uniformly over $(q_1,q_2)$, in the uncertainty
    parameter $\gamma$, with higher uncertainty increasing the
    difference.
    The white dot on the bottom, left plot corresponds to the
    parameters chosen for the experiments in this article.

The parameters chosen in this article's numerical experiments
are $C=1,\gamma=0.05,q_1=e^2/3\approx2.5,q_2=3$. This point lies
in the region where the $L^2$ difference is around $0.012$ --- see the
white dot in the
bottom, left subfigure in \Cref{fig:policy_diff_heatmaps}.
This difference is in the lower range of that seen for all the
combinations of parameters, so the conclusions made in the article
should be considered as relevant for a wider range of systems.
