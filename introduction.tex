\section{Introduction}
The process of pricing products in order to control demand and
maximize revenues has been undertaken for centuries. In recent
decades, data- and model-driven approaches have become increasingly
popular in order to advise on and automate the process for companies.
There are several success stories from early adopters, for example in
the airline industry.\todo{Reference}
For retailers with billions of pounds in revenues, small
improvements to their revenue-management processes is worth millions
of pounds.
Unsold items add up to thousands of tonnes of waste per year, so
improving the control of demand for products is advantageous
for both retailers and the environment.

We are interested in strategies to dynamically set the prices of products, and
formulate the problem as a stochastic optimal control problem.
Product stock levels $(S)_t$ are controlled by a pricing process
$(\alpha)_t$, and evolve according to a dynamic system with random disturbances
${(W)}_t$:
\begin{equation}
S_{t+1}=f_{t+1}(S_t,\alpha_t,W_{t+1})
\end{equation}
The goal is to find $\alpha$ which maximises the revenues $U_t$
given time horizon $T$, and
minimises the costs $\overline{U}$ of unsold stock:
\begin{equation}
  \max_{\alpha}\mathbb E_W\left[ \sum_{t=0}^TU_t(S_t,\alpha_t,W_{t+1})
  - \overline{U}(S_T)\right]
\end{equation}
The solution to this problem can be found by solving the associated
Bellman equation. In practical applications, it is almost always
intractable to solve the control problem to optimality.
Thus, algorithms based on approximations and heuristics are employed.
There are several proposed approximations in the
literature\todo{Mention a few?}, although most of the domain knowledge is kept within
respective commercial actors.
Many of these algorithms are justified solely on practical grounds, or
from asymptotic results.\todo{References}
In this paper, we will consider four approximations known as
lookahead policies,
and evaluate their performance on a one-product system.
We find that the optimal policy is more robust to
miss-specification of the model uncertainty in the system.
Hence, the use of approximations puts more pressure on the
demand forecasting process.

The paper is organised as follows:\todo{Write this out}
\begin{itemize}
\item Section 2: Mathematical formulation of the problem, an algorithm
  to solve it based on Bellman's equation, and an example with pricing rules.
\item Section 3: Discussion of some approximations (list them), and
  comparison with the bellman controller in the example
\item Section 4: What happens when the model is not correct?
% \item (MAYBE) Section 5: Risk-averse. Formulation, impact
%   (exponential, power, quadratic)
\item Section 5: Conclusion
\end{itemize}
